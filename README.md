## Technical Summary

The Real-time Social Data Analytics Pipeline is a comprehensive, cloud-native solution leveraging AWS services to create a scalable, serverless data processing system. The pipeline ingests social media data through Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, processes it using AWS Lambda functions for sentiment analysis, and stores results in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Redshift for quick access and complex analytical queries respectively. AWS Step Functions orchestrates the workflow, ensuring reliable execution and error handling, while Amazon QuickSight enables intuitive data visualization of social media trends and sentiments. The entire infrastructure is defined and deployed using AWS CloudFormation, with CI/CD implemented via AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, automating build, test, and deployment processes. Security is ensured through AWS IAM and KMS, with sensitive information managed by AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, while monitoring and logging are handled by Amazon CloudWatch, providing comprehensive insights into the pipeline's health and performance. This project demonstrates advanced use of AWS services, showcasing best practices in cloud architecture including serverless computing, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, security, and monitoring.
